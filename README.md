# AutoEncoder

This autoencoder-based study proposes a novel methodology for noise removal in plant leaf images, enhancing subsequent analysis for disease detection, species identification, stress response assessment and efficient storage of information. The compressed latent space representation learned by the autoencoder effectively filters noise while preserving vital leaf features, leading to improved accuracy and deeper insights into plant health and environmental interactions.
